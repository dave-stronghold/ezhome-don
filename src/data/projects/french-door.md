summeryDesc: 'Our new aluminum European French Doors have been designed to offer outstanding insulation properties. It meets the increasing requirements from the legislative and general market demands for the enhanced energy saving construction of new windows and doors. Offered in three varieties ST, SI and AERO it is the first aluminum system to employ silica aerogel. The nano-porous material has a very high proportion of free void volume compared to conventional solid materials. Its high pore volume, low solid content, and torturous path amorphous structure give rise to low values of thermal conductivity. Therefore the system features the industry leading thermal performance. In addition it also features exceptional rate of profiles inertia that allows for greater construction in size and weight. Version with concealed sash (US) is also available.'
