summeryDesc: 'Our aluminum Lift & Slide door is an ideal solution for connecting interior space rooms or conservatories with the outside balcony, terrace or garden area. Providing both a smooth & silent slide action operation, it can bring the benefits of a beautiful day outside, into the living space. In addition, our Lift & Slide Doors are great for space saving, and do not encroach the free space beyond the internal or external confines of the frame. Providing excellent weather tightness together with enhanced thermal performance, our Lift & Slide Doors comply with all of the requirements associated with this product type. Available in two different options, with regard to the level of thermal performance, “HS” is further categorized as “ST” and “HI,” standard or highly insulated. The design and arrangement of the system profiles enable luxurious openings of large dimensions, accommodating double, and even triple glass unit compositions, which in conjunction with the constituent parts and innovative technical solutions, help achieve a high level of thermal and acoustic performance.'
