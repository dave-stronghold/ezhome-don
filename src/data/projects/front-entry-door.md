summeryDesc: 'Front entry doors; aren’t they one of the most important parts of our home? They protect us from the cold, the rain, and the burglars, to mention just a few examples. Doors also keeps us away from street noise. But how do you make the right choice, and buy a door that will meet our expectations and serve us for years?

An issue that requires careful consideration before the purchase is the heat transfer coefficient (U). The lower its value, the more heat will stay with us inside. EuroStar offers paneled doors with the U! coefficient of 0.50 W/(m2 K).

When choosing our door, let’s not forget to check out their water resistance. It’s the water resistance of the door that will keep the driving rain outside in times of strong winds and heavy rain. The higher the class, the better the door protects our home. EuroStar offers paneled doors rated E1200 (1200 Pa).

We offer our Front Entry doors in a wide range of construction materials, and decorative glass; making for a virtually infinite degree of customization.'
